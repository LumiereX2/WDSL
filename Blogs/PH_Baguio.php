      <p>
        My trip to Baguio City — the “Summer Capital of the Philippines” — was an experience
        filled with cool mountain breezes, breathtaking views, and cozy moments. As soon as I arrived,
        the crisp air mixed with the scent of pine trees instantly made me feel at home. It’s the kind
        of place that makes you forget about city noise and just breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nestled high in the Cordilleras, Baguio offers a blend of culture, art, food, and nature. 
        Whether it’s sipping hot chocolate in a café, walking down Session Road, or simply admiring
        the sunrise at Mines View, this city never runs out of charm.
      </p>

      <h3 id="minesview"><strong>Mines View Park</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Mines View Park is one of the classic Baguio spots — the view deck offers a panoramic sight
        of the Cordillera mountains. You can also try on traditional Igorot costumes and take photos,
        or buy souvenirs from local stalls selling woven goods and silver crafts.
      </p>

      <h3 id="burnham"><strong>Burnham Park</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The heart of Baguio City! Burnham Park is perfect for a calm boat ride, biking, or simply relaxing
        on the benches surrounded by flowers and pine trees. Early morning or late afternoon walks here are the best.
      </p>

      <h3 id="session"><strong>Session Road</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The main artery of Baguio — a street lined with shops, cafés, and restaurants. It’s where
        you can find local delicacies, thrift stores, and even live music on weekends.
      </p>

      <h3 id="botanical"><strong>Botanical Garden</strong></h3>
      <p>
        A green sanctuary in the middle of the city. The Botanical Garden features art installations,
        native huts, and vibrant flowers. It’s a refreshing stop for photography or just quiet reflection.
      </p>
